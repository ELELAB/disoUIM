The repository contains the input data for modeling and simulations, outputs from analyses and associated scripts to reproduce our data. The the MD trajectories have been deposited in OSF due to space limitation. They can be downloaded from here:

https://osf.io/zfy9s/ 

A more detailed README file is in each subfolder

remd_analyses -> analyses of REMD simulations
metad_analyses -> analyses WT-metaD simulations
delta_2D -> prediction of secondary structure propensity from chemical shifts
helical_wheels -> helical wheels plots
uims_motifs -> data for logo plot

The files to reproduce the WT-metaD simulations associated with the publication are deposited in the PLUMED-NEST project ID plumID:21.046
They can be downloaded from here:

In the paper we also made usage of the code deposited in:

https://github.com/ELELAB/delta_cs to compare experimental and predicted chemical shifts.
